# My Nix monoflake

This flake harbors custom package derivations, image generation outputs as well as my personal configurations for Nix, NixOS as well as Home-Manager.

## Modules

- **default**: Simply adds the package overlay and the binary cache
- **cros**: Provides some configuration for Chromebooks. 
  - Installs Firmware via `hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware = true;`
  - Installs [WeirdTreeThing's UCMs](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/alsa-ucm-conf-cros)
    - Does not install modprobe configs that might be required!
  - Installs keyd and libinput, but **no** configuration. Run [cros-keyboard-map]() to generate configuration.
  - Enebles iio for screen rotation.
  - Disables TPM.
  - Will **not** override your configuration.
- **crosSetuid**: Installs `ectool` and `cbmem` with setuid permission to PATH
- **crosAarch64**: Fixes and slims down NixOS initrd for aarch64 and custom kernels

## Images

The images always include additional useful tool in addition to the NixOS ISO defaults and are preconfigured to run NetworkManager for Connectivity.

The following images are production ready and are [built by CI](https://github.com/ninelore/flake/actions/workflows/images.yml)

- **`raw-x64cros`**: Raw disk image for Chromebooks. While these are intended for stock (Depthcharge) firmware, they can be used for UEFI Firmware aswell.
  - Architecture: x86_64-linux
  - Latest NixOS stable kernel (`pkgs.linuxPackages_latest`)
  - Layout:
    - 1: 64MiB [Submarine](https://github.com/fyralabs/submarine)
    - 2: ~700MiB EFI Partition for BLS entries, but also featuring `systemd-boot`
    - 3: ~8GiB expanding ext4 root partiton
- **`iso-x86_64`**: Iso image for x86_64 UEFI. Basically like the NixOS minimal iso, but with extra tools, NetworkManager and the latest stable kernel.
  - Architecture: x86_64-linux
  - Latest NixOS stable kernel (`pkgs.linuxPackages_latest`)
  - Layout: ISO 9660 image

### Build Instructions

Refer to [`./lib/images.nix`](lib/images.nix) for a list of all available images.

<details>
<summary>Quick and dirty instructions for non-NixOS</summary>

1. Have nix installed and the experimental features `nix-command flakes` enabled
2. ´nix run nixpkgs#cachix -- use 9lore`
3. ´nix build github:ninelore/flake#nixosImages.&lt;Image&gt;´
4. Image will be in `./result/` or `./result/iso/`
